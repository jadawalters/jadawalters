                By definition, being perseverant, one has to have unwavering persistence or determination despite the numerous challenges that 
                delay possible success. I really push through till the end, regardless of the many opportunities that I could've given up. 
                Sometimes I feel like my life would be so much easier if I had no ambition. I often am awake, doing schoolwork so much that 
                when I'm not even in school my body my body still operates as such. I have to constantly remind myself of my personal struggles, 
                and the fact that the reason for doing this is bigger than myself. If I tell myself that this is something I want to achieve or 
                get a hold of, then I will do it, not a single soul will be able to stop me. I tend to value the silent victories the most, the 
                ones that persons barely know about or wouldn't even consider, usually the ones I keep to myself. As I grow older, I feel the inate 
                responsibility to make sure I give eveything within my being to anything I do, for future frution.
            </font></p>
            <p align="right"><font size="4">
                Being flexible, I try to make myself available to others as much a possible. Realizing, I live for more than just myself and as such 
                choose to extend my boundaries to others as in life we never know what can happen. Where versility come in is that I try to be able to 
                'vibe' with all different types of people. Constantly developing this strength by opening up myself to others, as a result learning from them 
                has made me more well-rounded, insightful, collaborative harnessing skills in mediation and having a sense of relativity.  
            </p>
            <p align="right"><font size="4">
                Finally, discipline. It often serves as a way to harvest progress. I have been developing this virtue by keeping my 
                personal goals in mind, trying to not stray off my path. This strength aligns with my path to divine greatness and has been proven 
                effective thus far.

                <i>Twelve Pillars</i> by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener is truly an inspiring and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. This novel is about a 
                man named Micheal, who met this caretaker of a nearby large property, Charlie, when his car shut down in a seemingly sparsely populated area. They become 
                good friends over the next couple of months as Charlie teaches Micheal, unhappy with his life, the "12 pillars of success", before he passes 
                away from terminal cancer. It entertainingly brings across how you could put your best foot forward effectively in order to achieve success.

                Although I had already known some of these methods, due to my own trial and error, it was nice being reminded of them. Below are the ten parts in no particular order that stuck
                out to me the most whilst reading this novel. Hopefully it will be of significance with you as well.
            </font></p>
        <ol><font size="4">
            <li>Writing down your goals</li>
            <li>Just decide what you want to do and then get started</li>
            <li>
                ‘What effect do my friends have on me,’ you’ve got to be willing to take an honest look at what kind of influence they currently have on you.
                In other words, are they helping you grow in the direction you want? What if keeping your associations the same, not
                making room for expanding any new associations or limiting your current relationships meant the difference in
                becoming what you want and achieving the life of your dreams for you and your family?”
            </li>
            <li>
                “Formal education will make you a living. Self-education will make you a fortune.” A successful person is always a life-long learner. Self-education is what you teach yourself. 
                It is what you learn along the way so that you are constantly improving and growing. How will you ever grow and expand if you aren’t consistently and proactively pursuing 
                knowledge and ideas that will move your life forward?”
            </li>
            <li>Time is shorter than any of us would imagine. If more people would wake up to that fact, more people would live differently</li>
            <li>‘Work full-time on your job and part-time on your fortune.’</li>
            <li>Anything of significance is going to be hard</li>
            <li>
                ‘Communication is two or more people working together to find the common ground of understanding. And when they find that common ground, they are positioned to
                have tremendous power together.’...‘Communication isn’t just what you say. It is also how you say it, when you say it, and the receptiveness of who you say it to. And that’s just the half
                of it. The other half is making sure you really listen.’ It is the character behind the skill. First and foremost you have to care enough and value the other person enough to want to listen
                ...most people aren’t listening, they are merely waiting for the other person to take a breath so they can interrupt them and speak their own mind.”
            </li>
            <li>“Live a life that will help others spiritually, intellectually, physically, financially and relationally. Live a life that serves as an example what an exceptional life can look like.”</li>
            <li>
                ‘You cannot speak that which you do not know. You cannot that which you do not feel. You cannot translate that which you do not have. And you cannot give that which
                you do not possess. To give it and share it, and for it to be effective, you first need to have it.’
            </li>
                </font></ol>
            <p align="left"><font size="4">To me, the best way to apply things to your life, is by actually making an attempt to do it. All we need is a little step forward, it truly goes a long way towards our divine destinies.
                As the character Micheal did in the novel, I too would start out by trying to achieve one goal at a time, then build by adding on more as I go along, carving my own path to success. This novel
                did a splendid job of breaking down success to show its achieveability. It was truly inspiring.
