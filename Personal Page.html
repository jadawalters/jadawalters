            Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Jada :). I am not one to necessarily talk about myself but if I had to, I would have to say that I'm pretty
            much your typical human being. I'm somewhat funny on occasion, I teach myself basic HTML and CSS in my spare time, watch shows on 
            netflix, drown myself in music, do schoolwork and text as if there is no tomorrow. There's nothing in the world that I love more KFC and hate more than 
            seeing crackers being put in tea (why would you want your starches wet).

            Now that I've gotten all the superficial stuff out of the way, it's time for me to bare my soul to you on this website. 
            Here's what really matters.

        <p align="center"><font size="4">
            I am 17 year old who deeply values simplicity and as such try to embody its minimalistic nature. This is because 
            when simple things, are in fact kept simple, the outcome is more effective. One does not have to be loud, to be heard, and hopefully
            this notion is conveyed to you whilst navigating this website.

        <p align="center"><font size="4">
            I generally feel a state of neutrality, not being happy, not being sad, not being numb, just somewhere on the borderline. These days 
            the emotions that plague my being are love and gratefulness/appreciativeness, along with feeling blessed, stressed, overwhelmed with
            a dash of anxiety at times. However, this tiny spectrum of my emotons are often hidden by my calm exterior.

            What describes my character? I believe that I'm a patient, giving and peaceful young lady. Very just and understanding. 
            Apparently, to others, I am compassionate, kind, intelligent, skilled, excellent, witty, discerning, open to learning and 
            strategic with interpersonal skills, good mannerisms and computer legiblity.

            Perspective is a very tricky thing, especially in what we think of ourselves versus how others view us. If I had not asked, then I 
            wouldn't know that how I typically operate gave off these qualities to others. That being said, I took two personality tests from
            <a href="#Keirsy">Keirsy Personality Test</a> and <a href="#SimilarMinds">SimilarMinds Personality Test</a> respectively. 
            Here are the results.

        <!--Reflection on validity of Personality test-->
        <p align="center"><font size="4"> 
            Generally speaking, I believe that both personality tests were valid. An adequate amount of questions were asked, geared 
            especially to what I would do in certain situations, carefully reminding to choose on that basis and not what I would want to do. 
            This made them very effective. Personally, I would say both tests captured my personality accurately. The traits mentioned or the 
            percentage of them tested are spot on as they were in line with the ones previously mentioned and even brought up ones I had not 
            realized but made prefect sense.

        <p align="center" ><font size="4">
            If I had to talk about something I most dislike, it's society and how we have allowed basic human decency to become of high priority. 
            Let me explain. We have become so distant with each other, self-absorbant, basically not our brother's or sister's keeper, so much that the 
            regular things that people do such as simply saying good morning is held on a high pesdetral of respect, due to lack of care to even 
            say it nowadays. I do not believe this should be and it puzzles me when person fawns over the simplest things I do for them as 
            if its not something basic that they are deserving of. The world has become cold, heartless and a toxic environment, and this very 
            same behaviour is even being praised and that's why we are doomed.
        </font></p>
        <br>
        <p align="center"><font size="4">
            all at once, yet so simple. The literal embodiment of of beauty. I feel at peace when surrounded by nature, it causes me to wander within my own thoughts, 
            exploring my depths. I love rivers because of the the whole concept of constant flow. I also like sitting 
            under the mango tree outside or sitting in silence with others and letting our hearts speak.

            In conclusion, I am a soul-baring enthusiast who has an appreciation for the disciplines surrounds her, me, through an immediate and 
            not so immediate environment, as well as through those around and the different platforms that align. I am still young and have a 
            whole lot to learn, so you are free to join me on this soul-searching journey as I display my rawest self whilst trying to master 
            being an introspective mediator through HTML code to the world.
